Description: chared is a tool for detecting the character encoding
            of a text in a known language. The language of the text has to be
            specified as an input parameter so that correspondent language model
            can be used. The package contains models for a wide range of languages. In
            general, it should be more accurate than character encoding detection
            algorithms with no language constraints.
